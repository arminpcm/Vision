# How does our config system work?
Instead of using YAML or JSON directly which would clutter the code with a lot of constant strings defining the fields, we rely on protobuf to load config files.

## What do you need?
1. Create a `.proto` file under [proto](Library/ConfigInterface/proto), this file should define all the fields that would be in your config file, also include a `BUILD` file and make sure all protobuf dependencies are added as needed
2. In your application
   1. Include header file for your message which ends with `.pb.h` and is autogenerated
   2. create an object of `ConfigInterface` class that is templated by the type of the config file you would be using.
   3. All you need to do is now to call `GetConfigObject` which would give you a protobuf struct that has the config parameters

No more constant strings all around our code, voila!
