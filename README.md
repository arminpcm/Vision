# Vision
Build Status:


[![CircleCI](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/img/gh/arminpcm/Vision/tree/main.svg?style=svg)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/gh/arminpcm/Vision/tree/main)

## Supported platform
Currently only windows is supported by the Container tools

## How to get started?
***NOTE:*** You have to be inside `Vision` directory for all the instructions provided here.


First, build the docker container using:
```
.\Container\Build.ps1
```

Next, start the container:
```
.\Container\Start.ps1
```

To get inside the container, simply run:
```
.\Container\Into.ps1
```

To return to the host, enter:
```
exit
```

To stop the running container run:
```
.\Container\Stop.ps1
```

Now, to build the code use:
```
bazel build //... --config clang-tidy
```
Note that this will run clang-tidy tests and would throw errors if the code is not compliant.

To run applications:
```
bazel run Application/Example/example_application
```

Or
```
bazel-bin/Application/Example/example_application
```

Make sure you are running cpplint on your new code:
```
cpplint --quiet --counting=detailed --linelength=120 --recursive <PATH>
```

# Hermetic python
We use bazel to provide hermetic build and run environment. In order to add packages, developers need to:
1. Add new packages with specific versions to [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)
2. Run `bazel test //:pip_vision_deps_test` to make sure the repo still builds
3. Run `bazel run //:pip_vision_deps.update` to generate a new [requirements_lock.txt](./requirements_lock.txt) file.
4. Once successful, push the changes to the repo including autogenerated [requirements_lock.txt](./requirements_lock.txt) file
5. Make sure `BUILD` files are added for Python code as well
6. Lastly, use `bazel run` to run python applications
