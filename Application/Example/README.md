# How to run example applications?
---
## What are example applications?
These are examples to show how [libraries](../../Library/README.md) can be used to implement new applications.

## ExampleApplication.cc
This application shows how a library can be included and used. You can look at [BUILD](BUILD) file and see how `example_application` is built.

### How trun ExampleApplications.cc
You can simply run
```
bazel run Application/Example/example_application
```
And result will be `11`

## ExampleArgumentsParser.cc
This application shows how you can use gflags properly to read commandline arguments. Steps:
1. `gflags/gflags.h` needs to be included.
2. Use `DEFINE_...` macros to define all the arguments, note that you need to use `  // NOLINT` on these lines since they result in clang-tidy errors.
3. Use `Flag_<argument_name>` to access the values
4. Make sure `@gflags` has been added as dependency to the BUILD file

### How to run ExampleArgumentsParser.cc?
You can simply run
```
bazel run Application/Example:example_parser -- --topic_name="Hello" --queue_size=10
```
And you should ge this as an output:
```
Topic Name: Hello
Queue Size: 10
```

## ExampleConfigApplication.cc
This example shows you how to use [ConfigInterface](../../Library/ConfigInterface/README.md) library to load config files into a protobuf message. We decided to use protobuf to avoid using string literals to access fields in the config file. Here are the steps:
1. Define the protobuf schema for the config under [.proto](../../Library/ConfigInterface/proto/) using `proto3`
2. Update the proto [BUILD](../../Library/ConfigInterface/proto/BUILD) file to build `.pb.h` and `.pb.c` files for the protobuf schema
3. In your application, include the `.pb.h` file that would be autogenerated under [.proto](../../Library/ConfigInterface/proto/) folder.
4. Create an object of type `ConfigInterface` and pass the config file path to it
5. Use `.GetConfig()` member function to get the protobuf message and use it to access the config fields
6. Create a BUILD file for your application, refer to [BUILD](BUILD), `example_config` binary for an example

### How to run ExampleConfigApplication.cc?
You can simply run
```
bazel run Application/Example:example_config
```
This will print the following output:
```
1, Armin, armin@vision.com
```

## YamlExample.cc
While we do not encourage you to use YAML files as configuration due to the code complexity they add, we do have `yaml-cpp` added to `bazel` and this application shows how to use it.
**NOTE:** make sure you are defining string literals using `constexpr auto` 

### How to run YamlExample.cc
You can simply run
```
bazel run Application/Example:example_yaml
```
And this would print:
```
Name: John Doe
Age: 30
```
